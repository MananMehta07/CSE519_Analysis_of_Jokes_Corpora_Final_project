# CSE519_Analysis_of_Jokes_Corpora_Final_project
We have uploaded all code and datasets to GitHub for reproducibility. The repository includes data_labelling.ipynb, which uses three LLM models to label the data. The labeled dataset is saved as Jokes_ensemble_learning.csv. Additionally, model1_model2.ipynb contains the training of two RFC models (with and without hyperparameter tuning) on labelled data, while Deep_Learning_Model.ipynb trains a deep learning model on the same dataset. Sentiment analysis (classifying jokes as positive, negative and neutral) is performed in Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb and its results are stored as sentiment_analysis_results.  Lastly, humor_detection.ipynb performs a humor detection task using the original data.
